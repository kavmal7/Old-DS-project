## Data Science Project
This repository contains an older Data Science project I did a while back. The project analyses biking data over a bridge in my home city. The files `preparation.ipynb` and `model.ipynb` concern the data preparation and model predictions respectively.
I also have `app.py`, which uses a website made with Flask, where one can make predictions given some inputs. 

The data and some files are missing due to size limitations, but the core files here can still be valuable.
